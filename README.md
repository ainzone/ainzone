## 👨‍🏫 About Me

I am a **Research Associate** and **University Lecturer** for Programming and Distributed Systems at [Pforzheim University](https://www.hs-pforzheim.de/en/profile/andreasschneider), where I contribute to both Bachelor's and Master's level teaching in the Department of Digital Business Management. I am especially interested in backend development, microservices, and RESTful architectures, and I enjoy helping students build practical, real-world skills in software engineering.

Outside the academic sphere, I run a small business providing **project management** and **webmaster services**, maintaining over 50 client websites powered by [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress). I enjoy combining technology and strategy to deliver well-managed digital platforms for diverse professional sectors.

## 🔧 What I’m Currently Working With

I currently focus on:

- 🌱 Java-based **microservices** with [**Quarkus**](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus) and **Jakarta REST**
- 🛠 Static site generation using [**HUGO**](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) with the **Hextra** theme
- 📦 Experimenting with **Docker** for containerised deployment
- ✍ Writing structured technical content in **Markdown**
- 💻 Developing clean and accessible web experiences using `PHP`, `SQL`, `CSS`, and `HTML`
